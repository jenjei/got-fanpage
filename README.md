# Game of Thrones Fan Page 👸🏼🤴🏽

This small page lists all your favourite GoT characters and even more information will be displayed when the character on the list is clicked!

I made this page with vanilla Javascript-HTML-CSS, using bootstrap for pagination. Back to the roots, so to say.

API: https://thronesapi.com/

I wanted to mimic the original api page and do it without any tutorials/ help.

Bootstrap Pagination was the hardest part here but I surely learned to use it.

Page is looking like this ✨
